# Automation Toolbox
## Python · Bash · PowerShell

This repo serves as a general placeholder for Python, Bash and PowerShell material, and other CLI snippets that I want to keep track of, for future reference and educational purposes.

 * Some of the scripts were used for Qwiklabs, Colab, and Jupyter practices.

### Pythonic modules cheat sheet:
Multiprocessing (CPU-bound tasks):
 ** from multiprocessing import Pool
Thread and process pool executors:
 ** from concurrent import futures
Beautiful Soup:
 ** from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
MSTICPy (>v3.8, if working on local, create a virtual environment first):
 ** import msticpy as mp
NumPy ("pip3 install matplotlib" on virtual environment):
 ** import numpy as np
PyTorch (>v3.8, if CUDA support is needed with NVIDIA GPUs, check the Tensors documentation):
 ** import torch
 ** torch.cuda.is_available()
Pandas (>v3.9, use Anaconda to install the PyData stack. This includes Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, etc):
 ** https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf
